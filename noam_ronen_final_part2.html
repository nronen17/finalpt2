    <p> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.) </p>
    <p> answer 3. the most challenging part by far was the contact page I never had such a big Javascript project it took me a couple days to work on. </p>
    <p> How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </p>

    <p> Answer 5. the single best advice that I could give would be know how to use stack overflow and google effectivly. most of the time when my code was not working or I didn't know how to fix something that would help. </p>
